# Deal-or-Nodeal-Game

# Introduction

This was the very first project that I did at Ironhack. The brief for this project was to create a simple game using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

My game "Deal or No Deal" is based on a popular american TV show. The goal of the game is to walk out with the million dollars.

# Rules:

1. The contestant chooses one of 26 numbered briefcases at the start of the game, which he thinks is the lucky one.

Each briefcase contains a cash value from $1 to $1000000

2. Then the player starts to open the boxes, one by one, choosing the once he thinks have lower amounts of cash.

In the first round, the contestant chooses six cases to eliminate from play, one at a time. After each case the amount inside is removed from the money tree.

3. After several opened boxes (7,14,19,24), there will be banker's proposition to either take his deal and finish the game, or keep playing, trying your further luck.

4. Once only 2 boxes remain (the one you picked and last available box), you again have two options:
   Either keep your case or choose the banker's deal.

5. If the player refuses the banker's deal and the player's case had bigger amount, he wins the game.

Also if player takes the banker's deal and his case was with a smaller amount, he also wins the game.

Otherswise, if the chosen amount is less, the player has lost the game.

# Hope you will enjoy the game:
